What is this?:
  This is the basic lframework for an SDL2 game engine I've been developing for about 4 months (October 2021 - February 2022)
  that seeks to frame different aspects of games through individual systems that are allocated the main system information
  such as display/input/etc. 

Goals:
  To understand development with SDL2/C++ more and to efficently debug and test different systems in a game with the modular
  approach of system handlers being individually developed on their own and coming together through how the overall
  software decides when to run each piece of software
